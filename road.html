        <h1>Road Transportation</h1>
        <p>Road transportation is the most common form of travel for both people and goods. 
            It involves vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, bicycles, and motorcycles that use road networks.</p>

            <h2>Types of road transportation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passenger Vehicles:</strong> Cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and buses.</li>
                <li><strong>Freight Vehicles:</strong> Trucks, lorries, and delivery vans used for transporting goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Transit:</strong> Buses, trams, and coaches that help reduce the number of individual cars on the road.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Motorized: </strong> Bicycles, rickshaws, and walking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Environmental Impact of Road Transportation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Traditional road vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel emit 
                    greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as particulate matter and 
                    other pollutants that degrade air quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Congestion:</strong>Traffic congestion increases fuel consumption and emissions, leading to inefficiencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Noise Pollution:</strong> Road traffic contributes to significant noise pollution, especially in urban areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric Vehicles (EVs):</strong> EVs are helping mitigate the environmental impact by reducing CO2 emissions, 
                    though their environmental benefits depend on how the electricity is generated</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sustainability Measures</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Electric Vehicles (EVs): </strong> Using renewable energy sources for charging EVs can significantly 
                    reduce their carbon footprint.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Transportation:</strong> Encouraging the use of buses, trains, and trams 
                    helps reduce the number of cars on the road, leading to less congestion and emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Biking and Walking:</strong>Non-motorized transport options reduce emissions,
                     improve health, and decrease traffic congestion.</li>
