        <h1>Air Transportation</h1>
        <p>Air transportation includes all types of travel by aircraft, from short domestic flights to long international journeys.</p>

            <h2>Types of Air Transportation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Commercial Flights:</strong> These include large passenger aircraft used by airlines for domestic and international travel (e.g., Boeing 747, Airbus A320).</li>
                <li><strong>Private Jets:</strong> Smaller aircraft used for personal or business travel, typically involving fewer passengers.</li>
                <li><strong>Cargo Planes:</strong>Aircraft used specifically for the transportation of goods and freight, such as the Boeing 747F.</li>
                <li><strong>Helicopters: </strong> Used for shorter trips, such as medical emergencies, air taxis, and private transportation.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="vehicle-type">
            <h2>Environmental Impact of Air Transportation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carbon Emissions:</strong> Aircraft burn large amounts of jet fuel, emitting significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) per passenger. Long-haul flights
                     have a larger carbon footprint than short-haul flights due to fuel consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>High Altitude Emissions:</strong> Emissions from aircraft at high altitudes (contrails and nitrogen oxide emissions) have 
                    a greater warming effect on the planet compared to ground-level emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Noise Pollution: </strong> Airports and aircraft generate substantial noise pollution, especially in urban areas.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="vehicle-type">
            <h2>Sustainability Measures</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF):</strong> SAF is made from renewable resources and 
                    can help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric and Hybrid Aircraft:</strong>These technologies are in development and may revolutionize 
                    air travel, reducing dependence on fossil fuels.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Aircraft Design:</strong> Innovations such as lighter materials and more efficient engines 
                    are aimed at reducing fuel consumption and emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Offsetting: </strong>  Some airlines offer passengers the option to offset their carbon emissions
                     by investing in environmental projects (e.g., reforestation).</li>
