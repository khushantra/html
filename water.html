        <h1>Water Transportation</h1>
        <p>Water transportation involves the movement of goods and people via bodies of
             water, including oceans, rivers, and lakes. It includes ships, boats, ferries, and submarines.</p>

            <h2>Types of Water Transportation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cargo Ships: </strong> ships used for transporting bulk goods such as oil, coal, grain, and containers.
                <li><strong>Passenger Ferries:</strong> Smaller boats used to transport passengers, often between islands or across bodies of water.</li>
                <li><strong>Cruise Ships:</strong> Large ships that offer leisure travel for passengers, 
                    typically with amenities such as pools, restaurants, and entertainment.</li>
                <li><strong>Tankers and Bulk Carriers:</strong> Specialized ships designed for transporting 
                    liquid cargo (e.g., oil tankers) or bulk solids (e.g., coal, grains).</li>
                <li><strong>Fishing Vessels: </strong> used for commercial or recreational fishing.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="vehicle-type">
            <h2>Environmental Impact of Water Transportation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Like road and air transportation, ships and boats powered by diesel or 
                    heavy fuel oil emit CO2 and other greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil Spills:</strong> Tankers and cargo ships carrying hazardous materials can cause environmental 
                    disasters if they spill oil or chemicals into the ocean.</li>
                <li><strong>Marine Pollution:</strong> Ships can release pollutants into the water, including sewage, garbage, 
                    and ballast water, which can harm marine ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Invasive Species:</strong> Ballast water from ships can carry invasive
                     species to new locations, disrupting local ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="vehicle-type">
            <h2>Sustainability Measures</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wind-Assisted Propulsion:</strong> Some modern ships are equipped with sails or other wind-assisted propulsion
                     methods to reduce fuel consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Fuels:</strong> The use of cleaner fuels, such as LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and biofuels,
                     can reduce carbon emissions from shipping.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-friendly Ships:</strong> New technologies are focused on designing energy-efficient vessels with 
                    lower emissions and better fuel efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Portside Infrastructure: </strong> are being designed with renewable energy sources and waste 
                    management systems to reduce the environmental impact of shipping operations.</li>
            </ul>
