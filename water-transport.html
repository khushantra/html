            <h2>Container Ships</h2>
            <p>Container ships are vital for global trade, but they also contribute significantly to CO₂ emissions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CO₂ Emission:</strong> ~15-25 grams per ton-mile</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Type:</strong> Heavy fuel oil (HFO)</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Major contributor to marine pollution and global warming</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="vehicle-type">
            <h2>Cruise Ships</h2>
            <p>Cruise ships carry passengers for long-distance travel. Their environmental impact is high due to their large size and luxury amenities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CO₂ Emission:</strong> ~250-300 grams per passenger-mile</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Type:</strong> Diesel, Heavy fuel oils</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> High emissions, ocean pollution</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="vehicle-type">
            <h2>Ferries</h2>
            <p>Ferries offer short-distance travel across bodies of water, but their environmental impact depends on fuel used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CO₂ Emission:</strong> ~50-150 grams per passenger-mile</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Type:</strong> Diesel, Natural Gas</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Moderate emissions, but electric ferries are a cleaner option</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="vehicle-type">
            <h2>Small Boats</h2>
            <p>Small boats, used for recreational purposes or fishing, can have varying impacts depending on fuel type and engine size.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CO₂ Emission:</strong> Varies depending on the boat's engine size</li>
                <li><strong>Fuel Type:</strong> Gasoline, Diesel, Electric</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Smaller boats have localized pollution, but electric boats are emerging as cleaner alternatives</li>
